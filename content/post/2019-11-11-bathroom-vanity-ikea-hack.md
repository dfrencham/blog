title: Bathroom Vanity Ikea Hack
markup: mmark
---

2 weeks ago I decided my pink 80's vanity had to go. It occupies a 1680mm space in the "powder room", which is not exactly a standard size for a vanity unit.

Ikea to the rescue. Having installed an Ikea kitchen before, I had an idea of the pain and suffering that was to come. The cabinets are decent, but do have some oddities. For example, Ikea vanity drawers are not solid, they use a weird slat system. On the plus side, the runner mechanism is an Australian manufactured Blum part with soft close.

*Ikea vanity drawers are weird, but work well*

To fill the space I needed 3 Ikea *GODMORGON* cabinets - one 80cm unit, and two 40cm units. 

Ikea vanity benchtops are only 120cm long, so I used one of their kitchen benchtops. I went for the EKBACKEN "concrete" look model. I had to cut it to size - kitchen benchtops are 60cm deep, versus 49cm for a bathroom benchtops.

The sink is a *HORVIK* and the tap is the tall version *BROGRUND*. Note that the sink includes a trap.

Plumbing was surprisingly easy. The trap Ikea supply is designed to fit in a compact space. It gets tucked at the back behind the drawers.

## Basic install notes

These cabinets need to be bolted to wall studs. You will probably find that the studs do not line up with all of the cabinet mounts. What you can do is run a small timber rail along the length of the wall for the cabinets to rest on. That will allow you to screw the rail into the wall studs at the bottom.

For the cabinets themselves, as long as you can get at least 2 of the mount points lined up to studs - that is fine. For the other mounts, drill 25kg rated wall mate plasterboard anchors in.

Cross connect the cabinets using these handy cabinet joiners (one per each corner of each cabinet).

The benchtop can be installed using some silicon caulk along the tops of the cabinets, with l-brackets if you feel a stronger bond is needed.

## Finishing touches

- used a bench off cut at the back of the bench to "frame" the vanity unit
- cut down some Ikea gloss white filler panels to fill the edge gaps
- charcoal black caulk between the sink and bench, and the back of the bench
- white caulk along the wall edges
