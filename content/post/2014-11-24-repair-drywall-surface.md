If you've tried ripping anything off drywall (like Tiles for instance), you've probably notice a problem. It utterly destroys the surface of the drywall. It is fairly easy to fix.

## Step 1 - Things you need

You're going to need the following items:

- 2 plaster knives. These are not knives as in 'stab stab', these are broad and flat scraper like tools. Plastic versions cost about $5 each.
- a tub of pre-mixed plaster. Get the "final coat" or "top coat" stuff. It spreads a lot more easily than the premixed "multi-purpose" version.
- sanding block or paper

First, use the sanding block to remove any bits of drywall paper that are sticking out, and generally smooth the surface. Don't be pedantic about it, spend a few minutes at most.

## Step 2 - Get your plaster ready

Open your tub of plaster. Mix it around a bit if the liquid has seperated and is sitting on top. Now, to get plaster ready to spread on your plaster knife, you need to "play" with it a bit. Remember as a kid how you would roll around a ball of play-dough and swap it from hand to hand? Do something similar with your two plaster knives.

Scoop some plaster onto one knife, then scrape it on to the other knife, and vice versa. Doing this a few times makes sure it will be easy to spread.

## Step 3 - Spread the plaster

Make sure your blob of plaster is in the middle of the knife, then put the knife up to the wall and spread the plaster. You want a fairly thin (but even) coat. If you put it on too thick, you will need to do a lot of sanding after it dries.

After you have spread the plaster on the knife, use the second knife to scrape the first knife clean. Then use the clean knife to scrape the excess plaster off. You want enough pressure to scrape the surface smooth and flat, but not so much that you are exposing the old wall.

## Step 4 - Let it dry

Leave the plaster to dry overnight. You may or may not need a second coat. Give it a light sand to smooth it over. If the new coat is completely hiding the damaged wall, then you are good to go. If it is still showing through, repeat all steps.

If the wall is not visibly smooth, keep sanding until it is.

## Step 5 - Finishing

At this point you are good to prime and paint. If you want to match the existing paint, chip a little bit off and take it to a paint store (or Bunnings), they should be able to get a near perfect match.

Now you're a plastering DIY expert. Awesome!
