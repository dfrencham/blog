I've had to find out the hard way just how destructive kids under 5 can be. I have two young boys, and an ever increasing number of broken devices.

This page is a running tally of the tech devices physically damaged or destroyed by my family.

<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/broken/broken01.jpg" title="That WAS a nice plasma screen."><img src="/images/broken/sm_broken01.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Broken Plasma Screen" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/broken/broken02.jpg" title="This iPad HAD a retina display."><img src="/images/broken/sm_broken02.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Broken iPad" /></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/broken/broken03.jpg" title="Nexus 4 - surprisingly fragile."><img src="/images/broken/sm_broken03.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;" class="pure-img img-thumbnail inline" alt="Broken Nexus4" /></a>

## Advice for Parents-To-Be

Here are a few tips so you don't have to share my pain:

- get LARGE rubber/foam cases for any devices your kids are going to use
- a toddler can have a rage attack and destroy a device in the time it takes you to get up and get a glass of water
- Samsung devices are expensive to repair
- Apple parts are fairly affordable, and easy to get
- don't leave charging cables hanging in places where your kids may (*will*) trip on them
- devices can be fixed, some times all you can do is laugh
