Kids destroy your expensive TV? Your $1700 TV? Good news dear reader. I've found a way to stop it happening again.

The answer is perspex! (clear plastic acrylic).

Perspex is great stuff. If I could, everything my kids go near would be covered in perspex or bubble wrap. Might be easier to just bubble wrap my kids. Stay tuned for a future DIY article on that. In the mean time, I had a perspex TV cover made.

## Plastic Fantastic

After the sad demise of my TV, I started looking into a TV protector, and thought "surely someone will make one?". Yes, they do. The problem is that they charge $250+ for it, then another $100+ shipping. They also use hopelessly thin perspex (3mm).

Time for Plan "B". I sketched out a design for a TV cover and started calling plastic manufacturers in Brisbane.

My sketch:

Result:

* 5 companies didn't respond
* 2 companies couldn't do a 90 degree bend in perspex (?!)
* 2 companies wanted to charge stupidly high prices
* 1 company who could make it for a decent price

Hamilton Plastics were able to produce exactly what I wanted. The price quoted was $160. Win! I submitted my order and waited.

## Measure TWICE

I went to pick up the TV cover. Disaster! The top part (that overhangs the TV) was 3 times as long as it should have been. Turns out that I didn't double check my measurements. The cost of fixing the mistake was an extra $70. Damn.

## The Final Product

Here are some photos of the final product:

It is fairly simple design. The TV protector consists of a large perspex sheet (6mm thick) with a folded section at the top - which rests on top of the TV. All edges are rounded.

There are two straps ($10 cargo straps from Bunnings) which secure the screen protector to the TV. The straps loop through slits at the top and bottom of the protector.

I added some stick on rubber pads around the edge, to protect the cover and the TV.

## FAQ

**How does the TV protector affect your viewing experience?**

I've been using the protector for one year now, and I've found that unless I look for it, I never even notice it is there. There is a *slight* increase in glare, but nothing that I've found irritating.

**How well does it protect the TV?**

My 2 year old has hurled matchbox cars at it, the worst damage so far is a few light scratches. I don't notice them unless I get very close (within an arms length), and actively look for them.

**Is it heavy?**

Yes. I have my TV secured to the wall, so the weight isn't an issue. If the TV is on a stand, it would at least need to have a safety strap anchoring it to the wall - just to ensure it doesn't fall on your kid and/or cat.

**How do you clean it?**

I use a couple of cheap microfibre cloths. The first one is damp with a bit of water. The second is softer and used to give the cover a bit of a buff/polish.

**Will you sell me one?**

No, The shipping costs would be a nightmare.

**How do I get one?**

Call or email plastic fabricators in your area. Explain what you want, and send them a sketch with the dimensions. It may take a few calls though!
