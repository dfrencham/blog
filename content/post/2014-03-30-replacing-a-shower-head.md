title: Replacing a shower head

A bad shower head is more annoying than you might think. It's something we use every day, but it amazes me how many people will put up with a rubbish shower head for years. You wouldn't put up with a crappy text editor for that long, would you?

It takes 10 minutes to replace, so lets get started!

Tools
-----

You only need two tools for this:
- adjustable spanner (wrench for our friends in the US and Canada)
- knife or flat head screw driver

You may notice instead of a spanner, I'm using a rusty pair of vice grips. The photos below were taken at a family member's house... possibly the only house I've found without a spanner.

Steps

<ul class="howto">
<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower01.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower01.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Old shower-head" /></a>
<h4>1</h4>Here is the shower head we are going to replace.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower02.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower02.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Not using a spanner" /></a>
<h4>2</h4> Turn the nut at the base of the shower head in a counter-clockwise direction (lefty-loosey, righty tighty!). Use the spanner for this, not the vice grips pictured.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower04.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower04.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Removing stuck trim" /></a>
<h4>3</h4>The trim piece is usually stuck on pretty well with a combination of rust and 10 years of soap. A butter knife or flathead screw driver will come in handy to remove it.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower05.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower05.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Taping it up" /></a>
<h4>4</h4>Wrap some plumbers tape around the pipe to get a good seal. Your new shower head probably comes with some plumbers tape.
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower06.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower06.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Screwing the fitting in." /></a>
<h4>5</h4>Put the new trim piece over the pipe, then screw the new shower fitting on (in a clockwise direction). Hand tighten it. If it feels secure and doesn't leak, hand tightening is fine. Otherwise lightly tighten with your spanner (if you do this, put a bit of masking tape on the shower fitting first - so you don't scratch the chrome finish).
</li>

<li>
<a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/shower08.jpg"><img src="/images/sm_shower08.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Admiring the finished item." /></a>
<h4>6</h4>Ta-Da!. Check for leaks, then have a well deserved beer/Coke/RedBull.
</li>

</ul>
